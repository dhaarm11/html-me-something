				My girlfriend and I both love to travel. Sometimes, though,  we have different ideas on where to go. We both like the outdoors and exploring new cities. She sometimes leans to having an all nature vaction, while I skew towards the exploring. Recently, we decided to find a national park that is whitin driving distance of a major city. This way we can expiernce the best of both worlds. We will be able to spend a few days hiking and seeing gthe beauty of the park, while also having a few days to visit local breweries and trying out restaurants of a new city. This website was an attempt to aggregate the information that I found was not readily available. 
				We are both Southwest Rapid Rewards members so the flying Southwest is our prefernce. I have provided: the top 15 national parks, a photo of the beauty of the park, a short description of what the park has to offer, the closest Southwest destination, and the drive time.   
				I will continue to use this as a source for determining our next vacation. I hope you find it as helpful as it has become for me. I will shade the parks for which we have visited in blue. If you have any questions about them or anything else, please email me: david.haarmann@gmail.com.

					<p>
						Yosemite National Park lies in the heart of California. With its &#39;hanging&#39; valleys, many waterfalls, cirque
lakes, polished domes, moraines and U-shaped valleys, it provides an excellent overview of all kinds of
granite relief fashioned by glaciation. At 600&#8212; 4,000 m, a great variety of flora and fauna can also be
found here. -UNESCO

						The vast natural forest of Yellowstone National Park covers nearly 9,000 km squared; 96% of the park
lies in Wyoming, 3% in Montana and 1% in Idaho. Yellowstone contains half of all the world&#39;s known
geothermal features, with more than 10,000 examples. It also has the world&#39;s largest concentration of
geysers (more than 300 geysers, or two thirds of all those on the planet). Established in 1872,
Yellowstone is equally known for its wildlife, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison and wapitis. -UNESCO

traces of human adaptation to a particularly harsh environment. -UNESCO

						Located in the north-west of Washington State, Olympic National Park is renowned for the diversity of its ecosystems. Glacier-clad peaks interspersed with extensive alpine meadows are surrounded by an extensive old growth forest, among which is the best example of intact and protected temperate rainforest in the Pacific Northwest. Eleven major river systems drain the Olympic mountains, offering some of the best habitat for anadromous fish species in the country. The park also includes 100 km of wilderness coastline, the longest undeveloped coast in the contiguous United States, and is rich in native and endemic animal and plant species, including critical populations of the endangered northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet and bull trout. -UNESCO

						Stretching over more than 200,000 ha, this exceptionally beautiful park is home to more than 3,500 plant species, including almost as many trees (130 natural species) as in all of Europe. Many endangered animal species are also found there, including what is probably the greatest variety of salamanders in the world. Since the park is relatively untouched, it gives an idea of temperate flora before the influence of humankind. -UNESCO

						Setting the backdrop for the bustling city below, Mount Rainier sits imposingly on the horizon. It calls to all those seeking the challenge of the climb, the solitude of the woods, the escape from streets and roads. One of the most visited national parks, Mount Rainier is the most prominent peak in the Cascade Range. It’s also one of the oldest national parks. Mount Rainier was established in 1899. At 14,410 feet, it dominates the landscape of a large part of western Washington State. The mountain is several miles taller than the lowlands to the west and one and one-half miles higher than the adjacent mountains! An active volcano, Mount Rainier last erupted approximately 150 years ago. Nearly two million visitors a year come to Mount Rainier National Park for hiking, mountain climbing, backpacking, and more. -National Parks Foundation
